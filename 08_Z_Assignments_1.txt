Your company is ready to start using Docker on some of their servers. In order to get started, they want you to set up and configure Docker CE on a server that has already been set up. You will need to make sure that the server meets the following specifications:

Docker CE is installed and running on the server.
Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.
Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.
The default logging driver is set to syslog.


[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]


Good luck!

Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic


Step1: Update the apt package index:
	sudo apt-get update
	Hit:1 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic InRelease
	Hit:2 http://ap-south-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic InRelease
	.......


step2:
        -downloading dependencies
	-Allowing OS to access repository
	
	:-sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
        
           Reading package lists... Done
           Building dependency tree
           Reading state information... Done
           ca-certificates is already the newest version (20180409).


step3: Add Docker’s GPG Key
  	:-curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add –


Step4:Installing Docker Repository
	:-sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  $(lsb_release -cs)  stable" 

Hit:1 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic InRelease
Hit:2 http://ap-south-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic InRelease
..................


Step5 install version:

    :-sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION>
	Example:sudo apt-get install docker-ce=5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic containerd.io

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
containerd.io is already the newest version (1.2.10-3).
docker-ce-cli is already the newest version (5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic).
docker-ce is already the newest version (5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic).

For non-root user has permission to run docker commands:


Step1:first create user


sudo adduser sameer


Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully

sudo usermod -a -G docker sameer

to take root user type: sudo su

root@ip-192-39-8-756:/home/ubuntu# login
ip-192-39-8-756 login: sameer
Password:


sameer@ip-192-39-8-756~$ docker images

Configure the default logging driver
	To configure the Docker daemon to default to a specific logging driver,
	set the value of log-driver to the name of the logging driver in the daemon.json file, 
	which is located in /etc/docker/ on Linux hosts
	
	note : if file daemon.json is already exist no need to create 

	{
  	"log-driver": "syslog"
	}

cd /etc/docker
root@ip-192-39-8-756:/etc/docker# ls
key.json

I dont have daemon.json file so ihave created daemon.json file and set the value for log-driver:

root@ip-192-39-8-756:/etc/docker# vi daemon.json

{
  	"log-driver": "syslog"
	}

    Restart the docker
	 systemctl restart docker

   docker info:

    Containers: 
    Running: 0
    Paused: 0
    Stopped: 2
    Images: 1
    Server Version: 18.09.5
    Storage Driver: overlay2  
    log-driver : syslog
